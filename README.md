# The_Little_Turings

## Repository Description
This is an attempt at the first project of the Machine Learning class at EPFL. This is a classification task on data generated by the CERN to study the Higgs Boson.

## How to use
The repository contains some notebooks, they contain our development stage to understand the data and to build models and test them. They also contain all of our results and conclusions about the data and our model.

The .py files (except run.py) are libraries containing functions we wrote during the development stage and that are reusable.

## List of files
- data (directory): data to run the train and tests
    - test.csv
    - train.csv
    
- exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: notebook containg data analysis and results, first step in our development stage
- feature_selection.ipynb: notebook containing feature selection results and conclusions, second step in our development stage
- project1_testing.ipynb: notebook containing the testing of our models and their optimizations and validations, third and fourth steps in our development stage

- implementations.py: required function for the project handout
- misc_helpers.py: helper functions that don't fit in any other helper category
- ml_math.py: some mathematical functions needed for ML applications
- plot_functions.py: some useful pre-written plots
- proj1_helpers.py: provided helper functions for project 1

- run.py: executable file returning our most optimized result for project 1
